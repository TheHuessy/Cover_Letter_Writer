I am seeking employment at The Barry Bluestone Paper Company because I am looking to advance my career in data analysis and lend my skills and talents to a focused investment company. I would like to hone my skills in research, data analysis, programming, and statistical writing while exploring other applications of big data outside of the field of public policy and gain experience in the financial sector. Working at The Barry Bluestone Paper Company would give me all of these opportunities and enable me to continue my career in data science.
