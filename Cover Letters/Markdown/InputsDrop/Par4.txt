Now, as I near the end of my graduate studies, I feel that I have outgrown my former roles and want to seek a new challenge, working with even larger datasets, developing insights that can further the mission of the company. I want to brave the new frontier in my budding data science career and working at The Barry Bluestone Paper Company would allow me to do so. I take genuine joy in researching, cleaning data, analyzing the datasets, and reporting the story within the data.
