1135 Tremont St

Suite 310

Boston, MA 02115

June 11, 2018

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am seeking employment at The Barry Bluestone Paper Company because I
am looking to advance my career in data analysis and lend my skills and
talents to a focused investment company. I would like to hone my skills
in research, data analysis, programming, and statistical writing while
exploring other applications of big data outside of the field of public
policy and gain experience in the financial sector. Working at The Barry
Bluestone Paper Company would give me all of these opportunities and
enable me to continue my career in data science.

I am applying for the Barry's Boy position because I feel that my
background and skillsets would make me an asset to the team. At the
School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs, I worked with many principal
investigators on a myriad of grand funded projects covering almost all
aspects of public policy. I was hired initially as an undergrad, for a
summer job, and my quantitative and technical talents were quickly
recognized and I found myself being pulled onto more and more projects
to provide any and all data manipulation and analysis.

I am very well versed in R, which began as an intro class when I started
my Masters and is now an integral part of my everyday work. Where some
wanted to keep using excel or SPSS to run analysis, I saw the
opportunity to use R and develop not only quality statistical analysis,
but also better visual representations of the data from simple ggplot
outputs to shiny apps written to showcase geographical differences in
data at different levels. Due in part to my policy background and skills
in R, I was hired by the Boston Area Research Initiative (BARI) to head
up housing and transportation data projects. Since January 2018, I have
built an automated web scraper that collects, stores, and cleans
Craigslist data, and most importantly I built, set up, and maintain a
local storage server for BARI which is now used to back up all big data
files and host local geocoding software.

Now, as I near the end of my graduate studies, I feel that I have
outgrown my former roles and want to seek a new challenge, working with
even larger datasets, developing insights that can further the mission
of the company. I want to brave the new frontier in my budding data
science career and working at The Barry Bluestone Paper Company would
allow me to do so. I take genuine joy in researching, cleaning data,
analyzing the datasets, and reporting the story within the data.

I look forward to hearing from you at your convenience. Thank you for
your consideration.

Sincerely,

James Huessy
